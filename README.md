## Comparing ALS and AutoEncoders for Collaborative Filtering on the Netflix Prize Dataset

This project presents a comparative analysis of two collaborative filtering approaches for movie recommendation systems using the Netflix Prize dataset: Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factorization and Deep AutoEncoder neural networks. We trained, evaluated, and tuned both models using a chronological train-validation split to capture temporal user rating patterns. Then they are tested on the probe dataset provided by Netflix since the official test dataset was never made public. Our results showed that autoencoders achieved 23.7% lower RMSE on the test set and 41.1% lower RMSE on the validation set compared to ALS. We expected training time to be shorter for ALS compared to the AutoEncoder however we found the opposite. We handled cold-start users and movies by using a simple global mean baseline which proved sufficient for the scale of this study. However, for future work we propose more sophisticated strategies such as user rating pattern matching for future work. Overall, this study investigates the potential trade-off between model complexity and performance gains under computational constraints.
